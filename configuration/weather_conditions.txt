# sun_altitude_angle: 90 is the midday and -90 is the midnight
# cloudiness: 0 is the clean sky and 100 is the thickest cloud
# precipitation: rain, 100 is the heaviest rain
# precipitation: determines the creation of puddles, values range from 0 to 100, being 0 none at all and 100 a road completely capped with water
# wind_intensity: it will influence the rain
# fog_density: fog thickness, 100 is the largest
# fog_distance: fog start distance, values range from 0 to infinite
# fog_falloff: density of the fog (as in specific mass) from 0 to infinity, the bigger the value, the more dense and heavy it will be, and the fog will reach smaller heights
